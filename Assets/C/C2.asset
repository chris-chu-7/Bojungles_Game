  storyText: 'You hop off the vine, only to meet a group of small indigenous people
    after trying to eat one of the tasty meats that you see on a plate around half
    a mile from where you encountered the muscular mandrill. These people are cruel, 
    and they are HUNGRY. You wonder, "Hmm, why does everyone want to eat me these
    days?" The chief challenges you to a soccer game, and you get to go free if you
    win. It''s a 2x2 soccer game, and you get to choose some teammates. If you win,
    you go free, and the other team will get eaten regardless.  Even if you tie,
    you still will get eaten: you HAVE to win. There''s no escape now. You''ve played
    soccer, but only until you were about 10 or 11. These people were all around
    4''6" so you''re like what''s the big deal. There''s 2 people you can choose,
    a muscular, 6''8" man who looks like he can knock out mike tyson, or a overweight
    5''5" guy with a bald head and a tooth gap. Which one do you choose?


    1.
    Mr. Muscles

    2. Overweight guy'
