  storyText: "\nTurns out things have not gone as planned for you, and you start
    to get sick of all the bugs that are gnawing furiously at your legs, and crawling
    up your body to all your parts, and you feel blood sucking on you. You're hungry,
    and you're extremely short of oxygen at the moment, and bleeding to death. You
    finally become one with nature within 5 minutes, as the bugs passed out after
    such a nutritious meal. \n\n1. Try Again\n2. End Game"
