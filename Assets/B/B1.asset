  storyText: "You take the vine, but the Bugs are still gnawing at your waist. Thank
    God there's no more other Bugs, otherwise, you'd be half eaten by now! However,
    You see a monkey on the vine, and believe me, the monkey is NOT a happy camper
    right now, and you're invading his terroitory. Think about a mandrill or chimpanzee
    on steroids. Fortunately, you got an grenade. It hisses violently at you. What's
    your plan of action? \n\n1. Throw the Grenade\n2. Give up and hop off the vine"
