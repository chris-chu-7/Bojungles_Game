  storyText: "The indigeonous player, named k'polo, slots it straight through the
    goal, and you were there to block the shot, and a feeling of euphoria shoots
    through you as you have survived. At the same time, the shot was so hard, your
    arm cannot move and felt completely broken. Luckily for you, at this moment,
    the US Air Force has found you within the hour and put you, bloodied, bruised
    up, partially paralized and euphoric, back to the F-80 for medical treatment,
    where you see your spouse and children again. You also made friends with Maradona,
    who gives you his own personal chef and lessons on soccer. \n\n1. Play Again\n2.
    End Game\n"
