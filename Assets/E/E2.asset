  storyText: 'You strongly believe that what you wanted to do is the right thing;
    however, your captors don''t apparently think so. All of a sudden, you feel a
    drill, and it''s going to your skull, kind of like punching a hole thorugh. You''re
    suddenly losing blood and began to wish that the insects actually killed you
    instead. A jolting pain goes through your chest as sulfuric acid is poured over
    your bleeding body, screaming for mercy, you feel a gunshot at both legs and
    both arms now. "Hmm maybe i could be a cyborg" you thought then you meet your
    end with an ax that decapitates your head. You then finally feel a burning sensation.
    Is this Hell?


    1.Try Again

    2. End Game'
