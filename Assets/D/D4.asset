  storyText: "You're in luck! Turns out this Short fat guy is no one else but...
    drumroll please... Diego Maradona. He's been really taking it on the drugs lately;
    however, he still hasn't lost his skill. The indigenous people are completely
    baffled, they chose the wrong guy as a teammate. During the game, he dribbles
    past the goalkeeper and scores a goal, however, 30 minutes later at the end of
    regulation time, he scores another goal, this time to be denied because of the
    handball. The aliens won't take another reincarnation of the \"hand of god\".
    There is a penalty, and this is the last play of the game. You are the goalkeeper
    and the 4'6\" indigeous tribe has gotten their hardest shooter to score the penalty,
    and you can tell he is really hungry. He fires a shot around 100mph. As a goalkeeper
    do you:\n1. stay in the middle\n2. Dive \n"
