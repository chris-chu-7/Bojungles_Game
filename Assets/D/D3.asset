  storyText: 'Mr. Muscles might look like a Greek God, but he is nowhere near Messi
    or Ronaldo. Within 5 minutes, he was tired. The indigenous people might be little,
    but you bet they were fast, easily reaching speeds of 25 miles per hours on a
    sprint, and they used their agility to score goal after goal. The game ends on
    a 0-11 loss for you. You hear the impending fire with all 4 of your being roasted
    for dinner, and see a sauce, smiliar to Hoison sauces utilized in Chinese restaurants.
    Suddenly, you''re passed out and everything blanks out. The people celebrate
    a victory with your meat, and this is the first time they ever had Homo Sapiens.
    This is a tasty treat for them.


    1. Try Again
