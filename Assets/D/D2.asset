  storyText: 'You jump into the water, finally relieved of the stinging that the
    insect poison has caused. However, you have broken several bones, and see your
    flesh float on the water. "Hmm" you said, "Maybe all my years of mental self
    destruction translated into physical ones". These are actually pirahnas eating
    away your flesh. You think to yourself, "Oh this day couldn''t get any worse"
    as you meet your demise as fish food, leaving your bones to decay at the bottom
    of the river.
