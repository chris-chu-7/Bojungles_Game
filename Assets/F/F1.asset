  storyText: 'It''s a week in, and you finally have your suit successfully built
    and ready to deploy. You use the blastar to blow a hole through the building.
    Alarms start to sound and you hear gunfire, but you are now free to go, and you
    feel proud of yourself for building such a rudimentary version of the Iron Man
    suit, which uses the potential weapon''s navigation system to take you back to
    Los Angeles Airport. You stand there after parachuting thinking about your kids
    as you await medical attention and your spouse.
